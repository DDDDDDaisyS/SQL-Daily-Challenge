## ABOUT x: if 'x' is not added, there will be a syntax error.
## ERROR: Subquery in FROM must have an alias
## SQLSTATE: 42601 (Class 42 â€” Syntax Error or Access Rule Violation: syntax_error)
## The correct fix is to give the subquery in the FROM clause an alias (i.e. a name), so that it can be uniquely identified in the query.
## You have to do this even if you are not going to reference the name anywhere
